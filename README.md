# Long story short


Hello !


At the beginning I would like to introduce myself !


I’m Patryk, and I have been working as a Software Engineer for 3 years.


My story began pretty long ago. I was about 6 years old when I asked the first question ‘what is going on behind the scenes’. It was when I saw a BIOS.


When I was 8, It was the first time I launched World Of Warcraft, and why was it important to me ? Not because this was a game just changed the definition of the MMORPG, it was because of the impression on me which began the following question ‘h- h- h- how it works ?!’


That impact makes me more interested in how to create ‘things’ on the PC, games, applications .. all of them. I started my own research but always there is something missed. The lack of materials, the missing person who can take care of me, and gives a hand if it is necessary.


On This blog I would like to create something that was missed in my babysteps. I want to share what I am working on currently. I want to give you my perspective on dev and courses that I hope help you to develop your skills either.

See u!
